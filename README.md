I created a Tableau dashboard using the "Tourist Attractions for Top Cities in Europe" dataset to visualize several key comparisons. These include the Price versus Attraction Index, Average Prices across different cities, the comparison of Average City Center locations to Average Person Capacity, Guest Satisfaction ratings in relation to Cleanliness, and Price compared to other components of the dataset. This dashboard provides valuable insights into the tourism landscape across top European cities.
This typically involves collecting data on the number of tourists, their origins, their preferences, and the duration of their visits to different cities. Such information is valuable for tourism authorities, businesses, and policymakers to develop strategies, improve infrastructure, and promote tourism in specific regions, ultimately contributing to the economic growth and cultural exchange in these cities.
